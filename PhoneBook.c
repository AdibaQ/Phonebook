Phone Book:
Should have several records (at least 10 people in the contact list to start).
Phonebook features must include adding, updating, and deleting a number.
There should be a find function that could be used to find a number by the 
personâ€™s name, or a find person to find the name of the person to whom this 
number belongs. Sort by name is required.
